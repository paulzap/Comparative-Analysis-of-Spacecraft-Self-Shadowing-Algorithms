# Comparative-Analysis-of-Spacecraft-Self-Shadowing-Algorithms
The effects of self-shadowing for spacecraft models should be accounted. This comparative analysis promotes general-purpose tools for SRP self-shadow modeling, suitable for real-time applications. We provide open-source code for dataset generation and algorithms implementations.
